        <p>This is how the memories look like in my head. As clear in the name this map unravels the childhood memories. It shows the cluster of memories is the center (atom look-alike) and all the important memories revolving around it. On one side there are all these important memories that I still have, and those I do not have anymore (in dotted lines). In the bottom it shows all the current memories flooding into the center. The memories are classified based on most important theme in the story (people, place, events) to make them easier to understand.  The triangle in the bottom left shows the interconnection between all three themes.</p>

        <h2 id="Why-inductive-visualization as map">Why inductive visualization as map?</h2>
        <p>The tradition maps foucus more on the Euclidean world, it is diffult to show something that is emotional and intangled (like this map). This map reveals what lies beneath the surface, silences, and unspoken elements bringing hidden aspects of the story into focus.</p>

        <h2 id="Discussion-on-Process-of-memory-mapping">Reflection on Process of memory mapping</h2>
        <p>As mentioned before, I classified my memories into three main themes: places, people, and events. While doing so, I began to notice patterns. I realized that spaces and places, hold very different meanings. Spaces, as abstract, physical locations, only become meaningful when they are transformed into places like when they are tied to specific people, events, or emotions. In other words, what made these spaces special was not the physical environment itself, but the relationships and experiences associated with them.
This process also made me aware of how time, memory, space, and place interact. For example, some places, like my childhood home that no longer exists physically. Yet, in my mind, they remain alive. This highlights how spaces, even when lost, remain places in memory because of their emotional values.
Some of my  memories about these places and events are trapped in time, while others have evolved. For example, my thoughts or perspectives about certain events may have changed, but the memories themselves remain intact. At the same time, I have noticed how certain memories fade or distort over time. For example, when recalling moments of pain, like an injury, I do not remember the sensation of pain itself. Instead, what stands out are the people who were around me in those moments and how they made me feel.
This interplay of space (as physical locations) and place (as the lived, emotional experiences tied to spaces) revealed a deeper understanding of memory as subjective and relational. Memory is not just about recalling a sequence of events in time; it is about the layered emotions, interactions, and personal meanings tied to those events.
